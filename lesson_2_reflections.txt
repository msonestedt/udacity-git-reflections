What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git directory is created. To be able to track changes with commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is a subset of the working directory and its contents are used to
populate the repository.
It gives the user opportunity to reflect what to add in the commit instead of
just adding everything.
