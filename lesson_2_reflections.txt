What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git directory is created. To be able to track changes with commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is a subset of the working directory and its contents are used to
populate the repository.
It gives the user opportunity to reflect what to add in the commit instead of
just adding everything.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
Use git diff and git diff --staged to compare the files in the working directory
and staging area, and staging area and last commit. This way you can see if the
changes are either too big, too small or just right.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
Trying out a new uncertain feature, multiple people working on a project.
The code is kept intact and working while people work on branches to later merge.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
It's easy too see which changes/commits are in which branches.
